    <h2>About storm wizards</h2>
    <p>Storm wizards are known for their super high damage, sure you sacrifice health but who wouldn't want insane damage</p>
    <p>You can always count on critting and damaging your opponent, so that is what you should do</p>

    <h3>What to bring to the duel:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Blades</li>
        <li>High damage hitting spells, preferably low pip so you can desimate your opponent over and over again</li>
        <li>That's about it</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Strats</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Start blading</li>
        <li>Hit, hit and hit</li>
        <li>Don't let your opponent catch their breath</li>
        <li>Win</li>
    </ul>
